Plan for Investigation, Analysis, and POC Building

The goal of this phase is to explore the Home Credit dataset and assess its potential for building a predictive model to evaluate loan default risk. This will form the foundation of a proof-of-concept (POC) for a risk assessment service targeted at retail banking clients.


Assumptions
The Home Credit dataset is sufficiently representative of data typically held by retail banks.
Predictive modeling can offer actionable insights into customer loan repayment risk.
There is interest among financial institutions in automated, data-driven credit risk evaluation.
We have access to the necessary computing resources (local or cloud-based) to analyze and model the data.

Overall Task for the Project:
To explore the Home Credit dataset, generate informative features, and build multiple predictive models that can collectively demonstrate your startup’s capability to evaluate loan risk robustly.

Step-by-Step Plan:
Step 1: Acquire and Prepare the Dataset
Objective: Download and clean the Home Credit dataset to ensure it’s ready for analysis.
Outcome: A structured, cleaned dataset without major quality issues.

Step 2: Explore the Data
Objective: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand variable distributions, missing data, and relationships.
Outcome: Insights and visualizations highlighting interesting features and patterns.

Step 3: Feature Engineering
Objective: Create new features that could help the models detect default risk (e.g., credit history aggregates, income ratios).
Outcome: Expanded dataset with enriched features tailored for predictive modeling.

Step 4: Build Multiple Predictive Models
Objective: Develop and train a variety of machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict loan default risk.
Outcome: A diverse set of models with evaluated performance metrics.

Step 5: Compare and Refine Models
Objective: Analyze model results to identify complementary strengths and weaknesses, refining where needed.
Outcome: A portfolio of models offering robust, diversified predictive power.
